# EventPlanningPlatform
An event planning web app

A new virtual ‘events planning’ company “Swedish Events Planners SEP” launched their business in Stockholm. SEP organizes events such as workshops, conferences, summer schools etc. They are responsible of all the details related to the event, for example: decorations, food, beverages, filming, music and many other details. SEP plans everything related to the event from A to Z. SEP handles parallel events according to each event requirements.

This platform has been designed to handle all the internal system of the company. Every employee has to login to perform actions according to his/her role. The UI for all the employees is user friendly and easy to understand. All the input values return a confirmation output if everything worked fine. The platform stores and retrieves all the data to/from MySQL, which, at the time being, runs in our localhost.

The web application uses the technologies of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Ajax and Bootstrap. For the purposes of this project we didn't consider that much the security of the system.
